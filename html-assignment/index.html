                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a <em>visual artist</em> based in Ottawa, Canada, and a graduate of the University of Ottawa&apos;s <abbr title="Bachelor of Fine Arts">BFA</abbr> program. As an aspiring <em>digital media designer</em>, I am currently a 1<sup>st</sup> year student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. One day, I hope to pursue a career that combines traditional art and digital design.
                </p>

                    In my spare time, I enjoy painting, drawing, knitting, and hanging out with my two cats, Theo and Leo. I feel most at peace when I can take my time, whether I am slowly sipping my morning coffee or sitting outside appreciating nature. While I am happy in my comfort zone, I know that I must step outside of it once in a while in order to grow.
